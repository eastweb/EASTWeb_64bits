--- This is the documentation for the installer

--- Prerequisite
	- batch file 
	- window registry
	- basic scripting language
	- inno setup
		- read the documentation of the inno setup utility (this provides a GUI for debugging) 
			- http://inno-setup.en.softonic.com/
			- http://inno-setup.en.softonic.com/download
		- read the documentaiton on the compiler 
			- our installer uses the raw compiler so you should understand what it is doing
		- if any changes needs to be done on the compiler side be sure you are testing it on a VM. Changes to your registry will mess up 
		  any/all functionality !!!!!!!!

--- How to run the installer
	- Navigate to the installer choice
		- there is an 86x and 64x (only the 86x is support due to gdal libs)
	- run the bat file
		- there will be some user input during the run 
		- most of them are for debugging purposes 
		- during file copy, there will be a user input for Y/N (choose Y to delete the unessacry dir)
		- at the end of the bat file, inno setup will start compiling your installer
		- inno setup will create a output director at the location of your bat file 
		- inside the bat will be a exe file 
			- exe is universal for all window 
			- the file should be around 140MB - 160MB if it is bigger or smaller than that size, check the installer and ensure  
			  that the installer has all the right binaries 
			- if not, use the inno setup utility to debug the installer
